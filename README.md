A game I begun working on in Java. Spent multiple days working on it. The sprite are not mine and were found online as I am no artist. The game is simple, w a s d to move, arrow keys for directional attacks (up down left right). There is no animation for attacking. E to access inventory which currently only holds wood as that is the only object in the game.
