# StickRPG
A game I begun working on in Java. Spent multiple days working on it. The sprite are not mine and were found online as I am no artist. 

The game is simple, w a s d to move, arrow keys for directional attacks (up down left right). There is no animation for attacking. E to access inventory which currently only holds wood as that is the only object in the game.

To run the game, launch the Launcher class from your commandline.

Things I learned:

-The JFrame and Canvas modules

-That packages are very useful and game development requires a lot of classes. I wish I had used these to group them rather than just have an unorganised cluster

-Handler functions are extremely useful for passing around objects between classes

-Getters and Setters are useful when you have a ton of variables. Having everything public and a global variable ends up making things messy

-I wish I had used Unity with its built in packages for game development, rather than try to build it myself

This project has been discontinued as I will try to learn it all in Unity.

Changes that I plan to make despite being discontinued:

- Implement the A* Algorithm for enemy AI's if the difficult is set higher. Currently they run at you despite being blocked by a path. This will add a layer of difficulty.
